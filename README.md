# 🌍 Climate–Health Data

This repository hosts **harmonized climate–health datasets** prepared for analysis, modeling, and forecasting in public health contexts.

The focus is on producing **transparent, reproducible, and well-documented country-level datasets** that combine:

- 🦟 Health outcomes (e.g. dengue, malaria)
- 🌡 Climate covariates (e.g. temperature, precipitation, humidity)
- 👥 Population data
- 🗺 Administrative boundaries

All datasets are harmonized to a common **spatial unit** and **temporal resolution** per country and are accompanied by rich metadata and provenance information.
